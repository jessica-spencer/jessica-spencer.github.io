        <h1>Increasing Contraceptive Choice: Opportunities and Health Impacts in Indonesia</h1>
        <h3>By Jessica Spencer | September 2024</h3>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Background and Significance</h2>
            <p>Contraceptive access is a key factor in improving health outcomes and economic opportunities. It helps reduce premature births, manage chronic conditions, and supports mental well-being.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>The study, based on the 1987 Indonesian Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, found that <span class="highlight">education plays a crucial role</span> in increasing contraceptive use among women.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the study examined factors influencing contraceptive use, focusing on age, education, and socioeconomic status.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Women with <span class="highlight">higher education</span> levels were more likely to use long-term contraception.</li>
                <li>Short-term contraception was more common among younger women.</li>
                <li>The probability of not using contraception decreased with both age and education.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The graph above illustrates that as age increases, the preference for long-term contraception also rises, while short-term contraception usage declines.</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 1.44.05 PM.png" alt="Education Effect on Contraceptive Method">
            <p>The second graph demonstrates that as education increases, long-term contraceptive preference also increases, short-term use slightly increases, and the probability of not using contraception decreases.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Investing in women's education is a powerful strategy to improve contraceptive use and, consequently, reproductive health in Indonesia.</p>
